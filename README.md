Overview: In the object detection problem, an algorithm locates objects in images or videos and classifies those objects. For example, objects in the following image1 were detected using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) v3 model trained on the Microsoft Common Object in Context (COCO) data set2. Deep learning object detection models can be divided into one- or two-stage methods. As the name implies, two-stage methods such as Region Based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN)3 perform detection in two steps. First, the image is analyzed to identify candidate regions. Secondly, a classification network is applied to each candidate region to determine if the image corresponds to a known object and, if so, that object's class. A one-stage method performs both the localization and classification with a single network in a single pass. The YOLO model4 is one of the most well-known and widely used single-stage methods. Two-stage methods tend to be more accurate but require significantly more computation; single-stage methods like YOLO offer the alternative set of tradeoffs. Sophisticated models like YOLO are often quite large. These models require large amounts of data and significant compute resources to train. In this project I tested four versions of YOLO (v3 to v8) on images.
